        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The following is a literature critique of the research presented by Belhumeur, Hespanha and Kriegman and their approaches toward developing a complex facial recognition algorithm whose outcomes are irrespective of both varying light directions and facial expressions.\n",
        "By focusing on two methods [Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces] the authors aim to explain and justify why both methods are effective and yet still, imperfect given the biologically induced challenges that our bodies present that in turn, do not so easily comply with computational methods made for executing these underlying scientific truths.\n",
        "In essence, this report looks to critique the authors’ approaches towards solving the digital challenge of facial recognition. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Content**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper in review discusses the challenges faced by three researchers in trying to develop a new and sophisticated facial recognition algorithm that is unperturbed by varying conditions.\n",
        "The entire paper shows how the authors are able to utilise techniques of Linear Discriminant Analysis to decipher effective processes that can be used by systems to mathematically determine an individual from the image taken of them. \n",
        "The algorithms being compared are Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, Correlation and Linear Subspaces. As it pertains to facial recognition, Belhumeur et. al (1997) states that most algorithms are reliant on the image of a face being treated as a ‘3D linear subspace’, that is, the face should become a mappable plane with multiple coordinates- so to speak. The issue with this is that, in practice, the digital mapping of a surface into coordinates can prove difficult due to a number of reasons. Reasons such as surface reflections, shadows, varying expressions, camera angles and changing facial features such as hair, accessories etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Firstly, the correlation method utilises the classifier of nearest neighbour on the image. The images in the test and training sets are normalised to have a mean of zero and unit variance of zero also.\n",
        "From here, all unrecognised images are gathered together and are numerically analysed to discern which image looks closest to the test set [image]. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Eigenfaces algorith maximises the scatter of the entire set using principal components analysis [PCA]. Simply put, Eigenfaces projects as many lighting variations as possible to maximise the system's potential of recognising the image. This algorithm is computationally simpler to execute than correlation algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The next algorithm being explored is that of linear subspaces.\n",
        "This algorithm requires that surfaces, in this case, the face, be treated as a Lambertian surface. That is, that the image[s] of a face can be mapped in a 3D linear subspace of the overarching image space.\n",
        "Linear subspaces 'represent all possible images of a specific object under specific light confitions' (Elhabian 2012).\n",
        "This algorithm is purposed for the digital reconstruction of each face using atleast three images 'taken under different lighting directions' (Belhumeur et. al 1997).\n",
        "\n",
        "Fisherfaces is an algorithm built on the linear subspaces algorithm whilst using Fisher's Linear Discriminant. It capitalises on some of the same techniques as those of linear subspaces to accurately depict images and their closest matches.\n",
        "This algorithm may usurp those previosuly mentioned as it maximises the ratio of the between and the within-class scatter (Belhumeur et. al 1997).\n",

        "**Innovation**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper was written in 1997 and it offers a comparison of multiple algorithms through which facial recognition systems may be improved. Correlation, Eigenfaces, Linear Subspaces & Fisherfaces are the algorithms being tested. At the time, facial recognition algorithms were challenged when their systems were put in environments where they had to observe subjects under different variations of light. \n",
        "Two experiments were conducted, each of which compared the four algorithms discussed. The first one experimented with varied lighting whilst the other assessed both varied lighting and facial expressions.\n",
        "One other area of innovation is in how they intentionally experiment with extremes of each photo in order to develop a better algorithm. Namely, in using the Eigenfaces algorithm, the authors sought to experiment with images each of which had to assume a 'ghastly appearance' (Lata et. al 2009) in order to train the data set to learn what to discern from imags of varying lighting conditions.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Technical Quality**\n",
        "\n",
        "The technical quality of this paper is of a very sophisticated level. \n",
        "The writers are able to articulate their methods and findings in the most appropriate language through which the subject matter findings can be described accurately.\n",
        "The paper compares four different algorithms best suited for developing complex facial recognition systems.\n",
        "The writers were able to compare all four algorithms whilst bringing up their advantages, disadvantages and simiarities compared to one another.\n",
        "This is evident in how we learn that the Fisherfaces algorithm was a derivative of the linear subspaces algorithm and how it also developed from Fisher's Linear Discriminant.\n",
        "The comparison of the underlying algorithms within the overarching algorithms of Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces shows clear attention to the intricacies of these methods and how one may inform the other.\n",
        "Minimal experiments were conducted, however, they were conducted with a lot of data. The were two experiments in total. The first consisted of 330 photos taken of 5 different people in different lighting conditions whilst the latter consisted of 160 photos taken of 16 people with different facial expressions and under varying lighting conditions.\n",

        "**Application & X-factor**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "It is interesting to note that the idea of developing a test set and training set pre-dates the last 15-20 years of work within the field of data science. Although technology has vastly changed and improved between now and 1997, our methods of analysing, treating and manipulating data are not dissimilar. As a matter of fact, it proves that often great minds are limited to the technology of their time. \n",
        "This would spark interesting conversations in the classrooms as it opens up the discussion to the cohort that we aren’t really doing anything new, but rather only discovering new things through old methods.\n",
        "Further, it is also interesting to note that we have found a way to uniquely quantify one of our main & distinguishable biological members (our face). In doing so, it may not be a stretch to consider possible future implications of this, where we could synthetically regenerate actual human faces identical to the original(s) whereby we could explore the fields of AI or create some sort of extremely accurate physical cloning device.\n",
        "At that time, my suggestion to further develop and train the algorithms would have been to attempt doing this on two 2d images such as cartoons. Considering that cartoons or similar graphical images are so maluable by the creator therefore creating a variety of facial expressions with varying skin tones, textures and shadows, it would've been interesting to see if this would've have helped train and improve the accuracy of the algorithms being assessed.\n",

        "Overall the paper was well constructed. The authors implemented good use of subheadings which was essential in helping us distinguish the different algorithms and their ways of ways of implementation. \n",
        "Along with that, the use of various visual media made it easier to comprehend the information that they were presenting. This included the use of charts, graphs, tables, formulas and images.\n",
        "Although this was an intellectual piece of literature, the content was delivered in a manner that a large number of industry participants could partake in reading whilst maybe not understanding everything in its entirety.\n",
        "The most challenging aspect of this literary piece was the language. In order to best comprehend this piece, one must have a high level of exposure and familiarity with classical physics and mathematics. This does mean that the piece is best suited for intellectuals with a degree of interest in this field. \n",
        "This piece is most definitely not ideal content for consumption of the general public.\n",
